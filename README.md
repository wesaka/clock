# clock

Yeah, so I made this *thing* while I should've been doing actually important stuff. It's a clock and a countdown timer for your terminal.

## What it does

- **Clock Mode (`c`)**: Shows the current time, updating every second. Yay.
- **Countdown Mode (`t YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM`)**: Counts down the time to a date you set. Perfect for glaring at while procrastinating on the stuff you should be doing.

## How to use this mess

### Clock Mode
```sh
./clock.sh c
```

Just your regular boring clock, updating every second.

### Countdown Mode
```sh
./clock.sh t YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS
```
Counts down to a given date and time. Stare at it while you defer all responsibilities.

## Future Plans

Might add more features, but letâ€™s be real, this is just something I whipped up while avoiding my actual work. So donâ€™t hold your breath. The idea was to hang this ridiculous countdown over my head and maybe guilt myself into being productive ðŸ«
